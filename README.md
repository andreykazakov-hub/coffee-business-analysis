# Coffee Business Analysis
## Project overview
Orbit Roasters is a specialty coffee company operating across multiple regions, offering a variety of ethically sourced beans in standardized product sizes. The company focuses on pricing efficiency, customer retention, and regional sales performance. This project analyzes transactions data from 2019–2022 to evaluate overall sales performance, customer behavior, loyalty program impact, and pricing efficiency across product sizes.

## Executive summary
Across 957 orders from 913 customers, the coffee business generated $45,134.26 revenue and $4,520.22 profit for an overall 10.02% margin. The average order value is $47.16.

The business is volume-driven by large sizes: the 2.5 size accounts for $23,785.57 (52.7%) of revenue, while margins remain ~flat near 10% across sizes. Revenue is primarily concentrated in the United States ($35,638.89 | 79.0%), with Ireland and the UK making up the remainder.

From 2019–2021, revenue rose from $12,187.17 → $13,766.11 (+13.6%); 2022 is partial (Jan 1–Aug 19) so it appears lower ($7,063.44).

## Key insights (deep-dive)

### Margin is “stuck” around ~10%

Overall margin is ~10.0%, and it’s remarkably stable across time (~9.85%–10.09% from 2019–2022).

By size, margin barely changes:

- 0.2 kg: ~10.00%
- 0.5 kg: ~10.13%
- 1.0 kg: ~10.07%
- 2.5 kg: ~9.96%

What it means: pricing is scaling up, but profitability isn’t. You’re selling more dollars without improving profit quality. This is a direct opportunity to redesign the margin structure.

If you can push even a small margin shift (e.g., from 10% → 15%) on the high-volume products, total profit moves disproportionately.

### 2.5 kg dominates revenue (and can fund growth)

2.5 kg accounts for ~52.7% of total revenue ($23,785.57 / $45,134.26).

Other sizes:

- 1.0 kg: $11,010.75 (~24.4%)
- 0.5 kg: $7,029.99 (~15.6%)
- 0.2 kg: $3,307.95 (~7.3%)

What it means: the business is heavily supported by a “bulk” segment. By improving margin on 2.5 kg even slightly, it will increase total profit.

### Best-selling Products: Liberica and Excelsa

- Liberica: $12,054.08 revenue (26.7%), $1,567.03 profit (34.7%), ~13% margin
- Excelsa: $12,306.44 (27.3%), $1,353.71 (29.9%), ~11% margin
- Arabica: $11,768.50 (26.1%), $1,059.16 (23.4%), ~9% margin
- Robusta: $9,005.25 (20.0%), $540.31 (12.0%), ~6% margin

Robusta generates meaningful revenue, but it’s the biggest profit leak per dollar sold. This is the most obvious place to raise price, improve sourcing/cost, or reposition (bundle/upsell rather than compete on price).

### Size economics: 2.5 dominates revenue, but “value per 100g” drops as size increases

Average price per 100g drops consistently with size:

- 0.2 kg: ~1.864
- 0.5 kg: ~1.491
- 1.0 kg: ~1.243
- 2.5 kg: ~1.143

That’s a big “bulk discount curve,” yet margin stays flat ~10%.
Interpretation: the pricing ladder is mostly scaling revenue, not improving profitability. There’s room to reduce the bulk discount slightly (especially on top sellers) while maintaining the value narrative.

### Retention is extremely low (loyalty doesn’t change behavior)

Only 2.7% of customers placed more than 1 order.

- Average Orders per customer: ~1.05 for both groups
- Repeat rate ≈ 2.6%–2.9% (tiny difference)
- Margin: both ~10%

### Almost every order is single-item

96.8% of orders contain only 1 line item.

Increase basket size: bundles (e.g., “tasting set”, “2-roast combo”), free shipping threshold, and add-ons at checkout to lift AOV without needing more traffic.

### Profit Margins

Profit margin sits ~10% almost everywhere (products + sizes), which is the opportunity.
Right now the business is basically “pricing-neutral”: you’re selling different coffees and sizes, but none of them are meaningfully outperforming on margin, so the mix doesn’t naturally lift profitability. That means profit growth mostly comes from selling more units, not from getting smarter about price architecture, cost control, or product strategy. If you can push even a small margin shift (e.g., from ~10% → 12–14%) on the high-volume segments (like size 2.5, which drives most revenue), total profit moves disproportionately.

### Geographic concentration: US is the market to double-down

- United States: 743 orders, $35,638.89 revenue (79.0%)
- Ireland: 146 orders, $6,696.87 (14.8%)
- United Kingdom: 68 orders, $2,798.51 (6.2%)
