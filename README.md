## Executive summary
Across __957 orders__ from __913 customers__, the coffee business generated __$45,134.26 revenue__ and __$4,520.22 profit__ for an overall __10.02% margin__. The average order is __$47.16__.

The business is volume-driven by large sizes: the __2.5 size__ accounts for __$23,785.57 (52.7%) of revenue__, while margins remain flat near __10%__ across all sizes. Revenue is primarily concentrated in the __United States ($35,638.89 | 79.0%)__, with Ireland and the UK making up the remainder.

From __2019–2021__, revenue rose from __$12,187.17 → $13,766.11 (+13.6%)__; 2022 is partial (Jan 1–Aug 19) so it appears lower ($7,063.44).

## Key insights

## Margin is “stuck” around ~10%

Overall margin is __~10.0%__, and it’s remarkably stable across time (~9.85%–10.09% from 2019–2022).

By size, margin barely changes:

- 0.2 kg: ~10.00%
- 0.5 kg: ~10.13%
- 1.0 kg: ~10.07%
- 2.5 kg: ~9.96%

_The pricing is scaling up, but profitability isn’t. Selling more units doesn't improve profit quality. This is a direct opportunity to redesign the margin structure._

_By pushing even a small margin shift (e.g., from __10% → 15%__) on the high-volume products, total profit moves disproportionately._

## Best-selling Products: Liberica and Excelsa

- Liberica: $12,054.08 revenue (26.7%), $1,567.03 profit (34.7%), ~13% margin
- Excelsa: $12,306.44 (27.3%), $1,353.71 (29.9%), ~11% margin
- Arabica: $11,768.50 (26.1%), $1,059.16 (23.4%), ~9% margin
- Robusta: $9,005.25 (20.0%), $540.31 (12.0%), ~6% margin

_Robusta generates meaningful revenue, but it’s the biggest profit leak per dollar sold. This is the most obvious place to raise price, improve sourcing/cost, or reposition (bundle/upsell rather than compete on price)._

## 2.5 kg dominates revenue (and can fund growth)

__2.5 kg__ accounts for __~52.7% of total revenue__ ($23,785.57 out of $45,134.26).

Other sizes:

- 1.0 kg: $11,010.75 (~24.4%)
- 0.5 kg: $7,029.99 (~15.6%)
- 0.2 kg: $3,307.95 (~7.3%)

_The business is heavily supported by “bulk” orders. __By improving margin on 2.5 kg__ even slightly, it will increase total profit._

## Size economics: 2.5 dominates revenue, but “value per 100g” drops as size increases

Average price per 100g drops consistently with size:

- 0.2 kg: ~1.864
- 0.5 kg: ~1.491
- 1.0 kg: ~1.243
- 2.5 kg: ~1.143

_That’s a big “bulk discount curve,” yet margin stays flat ~10%._
_The pricing ladder is mostly scaling revenue, not improving profitability. There’s room to reduce the bulk discount slightly (especially on top sellers) while maintaining the value narrative._

## Retention is extremely low (loyalty doesn’t change behavior)

Only 2.7% of customers placed more than 1 order.

- Average Orders per customer: ~1.05 for both groups
- Repeat rate ≈ 2.6%–2.9% (tiny difference)
- Margin: both ~10%

## Almost every order is single-item

96.8% of orders contain only 1 line item.

Increase basket size: bundles (e.g., “tasting set”, “2-roast combo”), free shipping threshold, and add-ons at checkout to lift average order value without needing more traffic.

## Geographic concentration: US is the market to double-down

- United States: 743 orders, $35,638.89 revenue (79.0%)
- Ireland: 146 orders, $6,696.87 (14.8%)
- United Kingdom: 68 orders, $2,798.51 (6.2%)
